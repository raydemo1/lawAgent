"""Neighbor chunk expansion for hybrid retrieval.

Issue 6: For top-ranked hybrid hits, pull ``prev_chunk_id`` and
``next_chunk_id`` as supplemental evidence. Neighbors are not primary
ranked hits — they provide surrounding context (e.g., the rest of a
multi-paragraph article, related definitions, or a table's header).

Neighbors are added to ``RetrievalTrace.neighbor_chunks`` with
``retriever="hybrid"`` and a special rank convention: ``-1`` for prev,
``-2`` for next, so they can be distinguished from primary results.
